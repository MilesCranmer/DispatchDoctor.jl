When applied, it ensures that the return type of the function is concrete. If type instability is detected, a TypeInstabilityError is thrown. You may also pass warnonly=true to only emit a warning.\n\nUsage\n\nusing DispatchDoctor: @stable\n\n@stable function relu(x)\n    if x > 0\n        return x\n    else\n        return 0.0\n    end\nend\n\nExample\n\njulia> relu(1.0)\n1.0\n\njulia> relu(0)\nERROR: TypeInstabilityError: Instability detected in function `relu`\nwith arguments `(Int64,)`. Inferred to be `Union{Float64, Int64}`,\nwhich is not a concrete type.\n\nExtended help\n\nYou may also apply @stable to arbitrary blocks of code, such as begin or module, and have it be applied to all functions. (Just note that this skips closure functions.)\n\nusing DispatchDoctor: @stable\n\n@stable begin\n    f(x) = x\n    g(x) = x > 0 ? x : 0.0\n    @unstable begin\n        g(x::Int) = x > 0 ? x : 0.0\n    end\n    module A\n        h(x) = x\n        include(\"myfile.jl\")\n    end\nend\n\nThis @stable will apply to f, g, h, as well as all functions within myfile.jl. It skips the definition g(x::Int), meaning that when Int input is provided to g, type instability is not detected.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"macros/#DispatchDoctor.@unstable","page":"Macros","title":"DispatchDoctor.@unstable","text":"@unstable [code_block]\n\nA no-op macro to hide blocks of code from @stable.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"macro"},{"location":"macros/#Utilities","page":"Macros","title":"Utilities","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"macros/","page":"Macros","title":"Macros","text":"allow_unstable","category":"page"},{"location":"macros/#DispatchDoctor.allow_unstable","page":"Macros","title":"DispatchDoctor.allow_unstable","text":"allow_unstable(f::F) where {F<:Function}\n\nGlobally disable type DispatchDoctor instability checks within the provided function f.\n\nThis function allows you to execute a block of code where type instability checks are disabled.
